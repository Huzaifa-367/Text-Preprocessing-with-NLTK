# Text Preprocessing with NLTK

## Overview
This repository contains Python code demonstrating text preprocessing using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library. Text preprocessing is an essential step in natural language processing (NLP) projects, where raw text data is cleaned and transformed to prepare it for analysis or modeling tasks.

## Features
- Removes punctuations, URLs, and stop words from text data
- Performs tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization
- Segments text into sentences

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- NLTK

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/text-preprocessing-nltk.git
    cd text-preprocessing-nltk
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Ensure you have your text data ready. You can either use the provided sample data or replace it with your own dataset.

2. Run the preprocessing script:
    ```bash
    python preprocess.py
    ```

3. View the preprocessed text output in the console.

## Sample Data
The sample data file `data.jsonl` contains JSON Lines formatted text entries. Each entry has a `"text"` field representing the raw text data.
